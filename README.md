# FluidSimulation

### Introduction
This is my [CSE328](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cse328/) final project.  

This project is an implementation of [Particle-based Viscoelastic Fluid Simulation](
http://www.ligum.umontreal.ca/Clavet-2005-PVFS/pvfs.pdf) which is a paper published in 2005 by Simon Clavet, 
Philippe Beaudoin, and Pierre Poulin.

This project is written in C and uses OpenGL as interface for rendering.
